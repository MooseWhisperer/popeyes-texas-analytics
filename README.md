# Analysis of Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen in Texas

This repository contains the "Popeyes-Analysis.ipynb" python jupyter notebook that was used to conduct clustering and geospatial analysis on the Texas stores of Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen for the course of Business Analytics in Spring 2020 at Korea University Business School.
<br><br>
Because the generated maps in the notebook were lost in the process of uploading the notebook, a .html file of the notebook was made available where they can are clearly displayed. Viewers are encouraged to use this file in order to see all the map outputs of the code.
<br><br>
Lastly, the accompanying .csv files were generated by the notebook, except for "Texas_Popeyes_Cities.csv" and "Suppliers.csv" that were inputs used for the analysis.
